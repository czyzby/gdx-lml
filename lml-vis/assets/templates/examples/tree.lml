<!-- Tree allows to create structures of data
    and choose a single node among them. It allows
    to add "node" attribute to any of its children
    (even indirect ones) that completely changes
    their parental behavior. -->

<tree padding=1 ySpacing=0>
    Converts text to labels.
    <textButton>Any child can be a tree node.</textButton>
    <slider node=true>
        By adding node=true attribute
        to a tree child...
        <textButton node=true>
            ...even indirect child...
        </textButton>
        ...you change tag behavior.
        Instead of appending children
        to themselves, tree nodes
        are created from plain text
        and children between tags
        with "node=true" attribute. 
    </slider>
