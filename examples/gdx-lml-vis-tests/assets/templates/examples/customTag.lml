<!-- Custom tags can be registered directly in Java.
    A new tag (both actor and macro), has to implement
    LmlTag interface - but doing as at its whole is
    pretty complex. Fortunately, you can use abstract
    class: AbstractActorLmlTag. While it forces you to
    override more methods than macro abstract - actor
    creation, handling plain text, handling children -
    it is still pretty straightforward. In Main class,
    we registered a custom tag for our BlinkingLabel
    widget (which extends regular Label). -->

<blink text="Blinking!"/>
<blink blinkingTime=0.2>Blinking even faster!</blink>
